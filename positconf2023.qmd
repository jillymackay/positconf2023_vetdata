## This talk is about:

Environment management

`environment <- culture`

-   How do we make the vet school environment **compatible** with the Posit::Conf environment?

## By the end of this talk

I will describe our three approaches:

-   Changing formal data science teaching
-   Changing workplace culture
-   Changing operational practice

You tell me what I'm missing

# Formal Data Science Teaching

::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::

## Our Teaching

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "R(D)SVS Educational Programmes (* Exit degree, ** Residential Programme)."

teaching %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Grouping",values_from = "Programme") %>% 
#  mutate(`Postgraduate Taught` = str_replace(`Postgraduate Taught`, ",", ", \n")) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)

```

::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::

## Undergraduate

-   Vets
    -   Curriculum overload
    -   Optional R teaching in research projects
-   Ag BScs
    -   All stats teaching in R from 1st year

::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::

## Postgraduate

-   Taught programmes
    -   New role created: "Stats Guru"
-   New courses within each programme
    -   Stats teaching in R
-   Campus support for R Teaching
    -   [R \@ R(D)SVS](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/)

## DMC Aims

> We want it to be as easy to ask for help with analysis, as it is to ask for extra reagent in a lab

## DMC Approaches

-   Book club
-   PARTYs (Protected Analysis Time in R (Yay!))

As a vet school, we have a LOT of quality assurance

## Where does operational data lie?

Case Study: Hofstee Standard Setting

-   Integral part of veterinary degree

-   Teaching data managed by Veterinary Teaching Organisation

-   Standard setting applied by academics (exam board)

What guidance do we have on making judgement calls with operational data?
