# This talk is about:

Environment management


`environment <- culture`


-   How do we make the vet school environment **compatible** with the Posit::Conf environment?

## By the end of this talk

I will describe our three approaches:

-   Changing formal data science teaching
-   Changing workplace culture
-   Changing operational practice

You tell me what I'm missing

# Formal Data Science Teaching

## Our Teaching

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "R(D)SVS Educational Programmes (* Exit degree, ** Residential Programme)."

teaching %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Grouping",values_from = "Programme") %>% 
#  mutate(`Postgraduate Taught` = str_replace(`Postgraduate Taught`, ",", ", \n")) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)

```


::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::

## Undergraduate

-   Vets
    -   Curriculum overload
    -   Optional R teaching in research projects
-   Ag BScs
    -   All stats teaching in R from 1st year



::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::



## Postgraduate

-   Taught programmes
    -   New role created: "Stats Guru"
-   New courses within each programme
    -   Stats teaching in R
-   Campus support for R Teaching
    - [R @  R(D)SVS](https://jillymackay.github.io/RatRDSVS/)

## And we taught R forever more . . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

renv::dependencies()


                Source            Package 
1               Campus/VetSchool  skilledPeople
2               Campus/VetSchool  staffTime
3               Campus/VetSchool  studentSatisfaction
```

# Workplace culture

## Data Methods Club

`skilledPeople::IanHandel("Data Methods Club")`



::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::


## DMC Aims

> We want it to be as easy to ask for help with analysis, as it is to ask for extra reagent in a lab


::: footer
http://pos.it/slido-B \| @jillymackay.bsky.social
:::



## DMC Approaches

- Book club
- PARTYs (Protected Analysis Time in R (Yay!)) 
- Occasional sessions
- Email help

Adopted [Recurse Center Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)

# Operational Practice

## Quality Assurance

As a vet school, we have a LOT of quality assurance

![R(D)SVS' new Director of Quality Assurance and Enhancement](content/director.jpg){fig-alt="Me, a late 30s white woman drinking a glass of prosecco in a beer garden, there is a child on my lap. Her face is covered with a star sticker."}

## Sharing practice


  - [Quality Assurance of Teaching Data Project Page](https://jillymackay.com/project/quality-assurance-of-teaching-data/)

  - [Sharing analyses with other institutions](https://jillymackay.com/talk/veted-2023/)

## Where does operational data lie?

Case Study: Hofstee Standard Setting

  - Integral part of veterinary degree
  
  - Teaching data managed by Veterinary Teaching Organisation
  
  - Standard setting applied by academics (exam board)
  
  
What guidance do we have on making judgement calls with operational data?
