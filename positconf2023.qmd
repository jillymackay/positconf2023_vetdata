# This talk is about environment management

`environment <- culture`

-   How do we make the vet school environment compatible with the Posit::Conf environment?

## By the end of this talk

I will describe our three approaches:

-   Changing formal data science teaching
-   Changing workplace culture
-   Changing operational practice

You tell me what I'm missing

# Formal Data Science Teaching

## Our Teaching

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "R(D)SVS Educational Programmes (* Exit degree, ** Residential Programme)."

teaching %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Grouping",values_from = "Programme") %>% 
#  mutate(`Postgraduate Taught` = str_replace(`Postgraduate Taught`, ",", ", \n")) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)

```

## Undergraduate

-   Vets
    -   Curriculum overload
    -   Optional R teaching in research projects
-   Ag BScs
    -   All stats teaching in R from 1st year

## Postgraduate

-   Taught programmes
    -   New role created: "Stats Guru"
-   New courses within each programme
    -   Stats teaching in R
-   Campus support for R Teaching

## And we taught R forever more . . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

renv::dependencies()


                Source            Package 
1               Campus/VetSchool  skilledPeople
2               Campus/VetSchool  developmentTime
```

# Workplace culture

## Data Methods Club

`skilledPeople::IanHandel("Data Methods Club")`

## DMC Aims

> We want it to be as easy to ask for help with analysis, as it is to ask for extra reagent

## And we supported R forever more ...

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

renv::dependencies()


                Source            Package 
1               Global/           consistentWorkplace

```

# Operational Practice

## Quality Assurance

As a vet school, we have a LOT of quality assurance

## Sharing practice

https://jillymackay.com/talk/veted-2023/

## Who needs these skills?

Where is the right division of labour?

# Have we finally solved it?

## Where is veterinary science at?

## Key Learnings

#| eval: false
#| echo: true

require(developmentTime)
require(flexibleWorkspace)
require(failSpace)
